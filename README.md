##  💡 Overview

This is my code to the MP3 PlayList Class challenge posted on [101 Computing.net](https://www.101computing.net/mp3-playlist-class/). The aim of the challenge was to implement a Class in Python to maintain an MP3 Playlist. The key features that we will implement within this class are the ability to:

- Enqueue an MP3 to the playlist
- Remove an MP3 from the playlist
- Load a playlist from a text file
- Save a playlist on a text file
- Shuffle all the songs in the playlist
- Display all the tracks from the playlist
- Count the number of tracks in the playlist
- Calculate the total duration of the playlist
- Empty/Reset the playlist
- Check if the playlist is empty

  
##  ⚙️ Requires

### 📚 Libraries
- `collections`, `datetime`, `os`, `random`, `sys`
